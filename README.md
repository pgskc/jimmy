Jimmy connects veterinarians and pet lovers to make pet health care much more robust. The current problem with brick and mortar vets is that you often have to schedule an appointment, drive out to the clinic, wait while your pet is being cared for just for services that could be resolved by a video chat. Also, it is costly to have a large brick and mortar location driving up vet care costs. All things Jimmy will not only make taking care of your pets much faster but also help keep costs down for both vets and pet parents! This project will have multiple phases that will be updated as this project matures. 

All things Jimmy will have 3 main components.
Pet prescription for monthly preventatives via a form
Pet prescription for prescription dogs food/ ointments via a form
Help vets get paid by the customers without having to spin up a payment integration.

Features to be included in the MVP
Forms to fill/request consultations from home
Payment Integration (leverage Stripe Payment Element)
